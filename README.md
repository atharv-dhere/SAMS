Developed by Atharv Dhere 

SAMSbyAtharvDhere is a pro-tier engineering dashboard designed for high-performance student organization. It features a glassmorphic dark-mode UI and integrates academic tracking with a specialized AI assistant to keep students organized, compliant, and focused.

## Key Features
EVRY AI Assistant (Beta): A specialized academic sidekick built to integrate with the SAMS environment. Currently in its Beta Phase (Full deployment scheduled for Feb 2nd), EVRY provides instant data on schedules, exam timelines, and attendance compliance. To maintain focus, the trial version is strictly optimized for academic queries.

Smart Attendance Monitor: Featuring a real-time logic engine that automatically calculates "Safe Skip" or "Required Classes." It ensures students stay above the mandatory 80% threshold across all 7 subjects by providing predictive analytics based on current presence.

Dynamic Timetable: A localized, high-visibility schedule that dynamically highlights active classes. It is designed to track daily academic flow and room assignments at a glance.

Finance & Task Suite: A dual-purpose management module featuring integrated expense logging and a persistent To-Do list. This allows students to oversee their budget and assignments without leaving their academic monitoring environment.
